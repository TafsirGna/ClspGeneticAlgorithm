The work that this document exposes is about applying two approaches based on genetic algorithms on a typical lot sizing problem: the \emph{Pigment Sequencing Problem} (PSP). In order to do so, we start giving a short view of the lot sizing problems in production planning. We go on doing the litterature review of the PSP. We give details on the different methods and models applied yet to this particular problem among which can be the approach based on the constraint programming and the one based on the simulated annealing. This document also does a short litterature review of the solving method that are genetic algorithms. Furthermore, we applied a category of genetic algorithms which is the hierarchical and parallel genetic algorithms. The trials performed allow us to compare this last solving method to the ones applied in ealier researches.  

\textbf{Keys words}: \emph{Genetic algorithm, production planning, pigment sequencing problem, lot sizing}.
