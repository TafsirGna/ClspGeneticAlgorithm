Lot sizing takes an important place in production planning in industry. It consists in determining a production plan that at the same time meets the orders and takes into account the financial objectives of the enterprise. Recent researches have experimented an NP-Hard variant of lot sizing problem: the \emph{Pigment Sequencing Problem} (PSP). Several methods have been tested on PSP. None of the tested methods is based on genetic algorithms whereas they showed their efficiency in solving optimization problems. In this document, we apply two solving methods based on genetic algorithms on PSP which are the hierarchical and parallel genetic algorithms. The experiments allow us to compare this last solving method to the ones applied in ealier researches. This very first results show that genetic algorithms could be fit in solving PSP.
